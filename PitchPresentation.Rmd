knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Shiny Application: Its URL and Main Objective

You can find the app in the following URL: <https://osorio.shinyapps.io/Course_Project/>.

It's main objective consists on comparing, through boxplots, one attribute among the following plant species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## A Brief Summary of the Data

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(iris)
```

## An Example for Sepal Length Comparison

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
dataset <- gather(iris, key = attribute, value = value, -Species)
finaldata <- filter(dataset, attribute == "Sepal.Length")
ggplot(finaldata, aes(Species, value)) +
        geom_boxplot(aes(color = Species), alpha = 0.5) +
        labs(title = "Sepal.Length")
```
